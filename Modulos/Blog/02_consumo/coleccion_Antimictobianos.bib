abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. An important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. This study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the University Hospital Olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: For the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011, resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. For the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (DDDatb) based on the ATC/DDD classification and in relative annual consumption (RDDDatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. The relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using Spearman's correlation. The level of statistical significance was set at p {\textless} 0.05.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 113,027 isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. There was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and amikacin in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Also, there was significant correlation between resistance to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. No relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.},

abstract = {AIMS: The defined daily doses (DDD) defined by the WHO are widely used as an indicator to measure antibiotic use in the hospital setting. However, discrepancies exist between countries in terms of antibiotic dosage. The aim of the present study was to compare, for each antibacterial agent available at our university hospital, the prescribed daily doses (PDD) with the DDD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data were extracted from the pharmacy computer system. Antibiotic use was expressed in DDD per 1000 patient days. We also calculated the ratio of number of DDD:number of treatment-days and estimated the average PDD for each antibiotic and route of administration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The average PDD did not correspond to the DDD for many classes of antibiotics. If fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins were prescribed at a dosage close to the DDD, other antimicrobial classes such as penicillins, aminoglycosides or macrolides were not. Overall, the number of DDD overestimated the number of treatment days by 40{\%}. For the most consumed antibiotic at our hospital, i.e. oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the PDD was three times the DDD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, except for the fluoroquinolones and the cephalosporins, the number of DDD did not correctly reflect the number of antibiotic treatment days at our hospital. This does not invalidate the systematic approach of the WHO and hospitals should use the DDDs to make national and international comparisons of their antibiotic use. However, each hospital should define and validate its own indicators to describe the local exposures to antibiotics and to study the relationship with resistance.},

abstract = {The imperative to undertake randomised trials in children arises from extraordinary advances in basic biomedical sciences, needing a matching commitment to translational research if child health is to reap the benefits from this new knowledge. Unfortunately, many prescribed treatments for children have not been adequately tested in children, sometimes resulting in harmful treatments being given and beneficial treatments being withheld. Government, industry, funding agencies, and clinicians are responsible for research priorities being adult-focused because of the greater burden of disease in adults, coupled with financial and marketing considerations. This bias has meant that the equal rights of children to participate in trials has not always been recognised. This is changing, however, as the need for clinical trials in children has been increasingly recognised by the scientific community and broader public, leading to new legislation in some countries making trials of interventions mandatory in children as well as adults before drug approval is given. Trials in children are more challenging than those in adults. The pool of eligible children entering trials is often small because many conditions are uncommon in children, and the threshold for gaining consent is often higher and more complex because parents have to make decisions about trial participation on behalf of their child. Uncertain about what is best, despite supporting the notion of trials in principle, parents and paediatricians generally opt for the new intervention or for standard care rather than trial participation. In this review, we explore issues relating to trial participation for children and suggest some strategies for improving the conduct of clinical trials involving children.},

A regression model containing nine variables explained 17.2{\%} of the variance in antibiotic prescribing. Practice location in the north of England was the strongest predictor of high antibiotic prescribing.

abstract = {Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.},

abstract = {This document presents guidelines for developing institutional programs to enhance antimicrobial stewardship, an activity that includes appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. The multifaceted nature of antimicrobial stewardship has led to collaborative review and support of these recommendations by the following organizations: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, Society for Hospital Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. The primary goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including toxicity, the selection of pathogenic organisms (such as Clostridium difficile), and the emergence of resistance. Thus, the appropriate use of antimicrobials is an essential part of patient safety and deserves careful oversight and guidance. Given the association between antimicrobial use and the selection of resistant pathogens, the frequency of inappropriate antimicrobial use is often used as a surrogate marker for the avoidable impact on antimicrobial resistance. The combination of effective antimicrobial stewardship with a comprehensive infection control program has been shown to limit the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. A secondary goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to reduce health care costs without adversely impacting quality of care. These guidelines focus on the development of effective hospital-based stewardship programs and do not include specific outpatient recommendations. Although judicious use of antimicrobials is important in outpatient clinics and long-term care facilities, there are very few data regarding effective interventions, and it is unclear which interventions are most responsible for improvement in these settings. The population targeted by these guidelines includes all patients in acute care hospitals. Most of the evidence supporting the recommendations in these guidelines is derived from studies of interventions to improve antimicrobial use for hospitalized adults. Many of these studies have focused on adults in intensive care units. Only a handful of studies have focused on hospitalized newborns, children, and adolescents. Few studies have included substantial populations of severely immunocompromised patients, such as patients u{\ldots}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hospitals are advised to measure antibiotic use and monitor its relationship to resistance. The World Health Organization's recommended metric is the defined daily dose (DDD). An alternative measure is the number of days of therapy (DOT). The purpose of this study was to contrast these measures. METHODS We measured the use of 50 antibacterial drugs that were administered to adults who were discharged from 130 US hospitals during 1 August 2002-31 July 2003. RESULTS Of 1,795,504 patients, 1,074,174 received at least 1 dose of an antibacterial drug (59.8{\%}). The mean (+/- standard deviation) of total antibacterial drug use measured by the number of DDDs per 1000 patient-days and the number of DOTs per 1000 patient-days were not significantly different (792+/-147 and 776+/-120, respectively; P=.137), although the correlation was poor (r=0.603). For some individual drugs, such as levofloxacin and linezolid, there was no significant difference between DDDs per 1000 patient-days and DOTs per 1000 patient-days, because the administered daily dosage was nearly equivalent to the DDD. When the administered dosage exceeded the DDD, such as for ampicillin-sulbactam and cefepime, estimates of use based on DDDs per 1000 patient-days significantly exceeded those based on DOTs per 1000 patient-days (P{\textless}.001). When the administered dosage was less than the DDD, such as for piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone, estimates of use based on DDDs per 1000 patient-days were significantly lower than those based on DOTs per 1000 patient-days (P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSION The measurement of aggregate hospital antibiotic use by DDDs per 1000 patient-days and DOTs per 1000 patient-days is discordant for many frequently used antibacterial drugs, because the administered dose is dissimilar from the DDD recommended by the World Health Organization. DDD methods are useful for benchmarking purposes but cannot be used to make inferences about the number of DOTs or relative use for many antibacterial drugs.},

abstract = {The defined daily dose, a popular measurement of antimicrobial use, may underestimate the use of antimicrobials that are dose-adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. To evaluate the effect of renal dysfunction on these measures, we performed a retrospective cohort study that involved patients receiving ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, or vancomycin, with use of defined daily doses and 2 methods based on therapy duration--stop-start days (i.e., entire therapy duration) and transaction days (i.e., unique therapeutic days). The vancomycin use rate for patients with renal insufficiency was 36{\%} lower than that of patients with normal renal function for defined daily doses, and it was 23{\%} lower for transaction days; for levofloxacin, there was a 27{\%} rate reduction for the defined daily dose. No significant reduction was noted when the stop-start day method was used. Compared with the defined daily dose method, measures of therapy duration are less affected by renal function and may improve comparisons between populations.},

abstract = {Background. Antimicrobial stewardship programs are advised to measure and risk-adjust antimicrobial use to facilitate interhospital comparisons, a process called benchmarking. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate a new benchmarking strategy for antibacterials. Methods. Hospital-wide adult antibacterial drug use in 2009 was measured as days of therapy (DOT) and length of therapy (LOT) from billing records in 70 US academic medical centers (AMCs). Patients were assigned to 1 of 35 clinical service lines (CSL) based on their Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group. Expected (E) use was determined by indirect standardization and compared with observed (O) use. Results. Of 1 791 180 discharged adults, 63.7{\%} received antibacterial drugs; the range by CSL was 14.3{\%} (psychiatry) to 99.7{\%} (lung transplant). Mean ± SD hospital-wide use was 839 ± 106 DOTs (range, 594-1109) and 536 ± 53.0 LOT (range, 427-684) per 1000 patient-days. The ventilator support CSL had the most DOT per discharge, 39.4±9.4 days; the LOT was 21.5±4.5 days. The hospital-wide O/E ratio range was 0.7-1.45; in 5 AMCs the ratio exceeded the 90{\%} confidence interval (CI) and was below the 90{\%} CI in 6. Variability in use was explained by the proportion of treated patients within each CSL and mean LOT and DOT per discharge. Conclusions. Adult antibacterial drug use was benchmarked to expected use adjusted for patient mix, and outlier hospitals were identified. Differences between expected and observed use reflect usage patterns that were benchmarked and are targets for evaluation and intervention.

abstract = {Clin Microbiol Infect 2010; 16: 1297-1302 Abstract Strategies to reduce rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) generally recommend isolation or cohorting of active cases and the reduced use of cephalosporin and quinolone antibiotics. Data supporting these recommendations come predominantly from the setting of epidemic disease caused by ribotype 027 strains. We introduced an initiative involving a restrictive antibiotic policy and a CDI-cohort ward at an acute, 820-bed teaching hospital where ribotype 027 strains account for only one quarter of all CDI cases. Antibiotic use and monthly CDI cases in the 12 months before and the 15 months after the initiative were compared using an interrupted time series analysis and segmented regression analysis. The initiative resulted in a reduced level of cephalosporin and quinolone use (22.0{\%} and 38.7{\%}, respectively, both p {\textless}0.001) and changes in the trends of antibiotic use such that cephalosporin use decreased by an additional 62.1 defined daily doses (DDD) per month (p {\textless}0.001) and antipseudomonal penicillin use increased by 20.7 DDD per month (p = 0.011). There were no significant changes in doxycycline or carbapenem use. Although the number of CDI cases each month was falling before the intervention, there was a significant increase in the rate of reduction after the intervention from 3{\%} to 8{\%} per month (0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.86-0.99, p = 0.03). During the study period, there was no change in the proportion of cases having their onset in the community, nor in the proportion of ribotype 027 cases. CDI cohorting and restriction of cephalosporin and quinolone use are effective in reducing CDI cases in a setting where ribotype 027 is endemic.

abstract = {Antimicrobial stewardship is a new field that struggles to find the right balance between meaningful and useful metrics to study the impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). ASP metrics primarily measure antimicrobial use, although microbiological resistance and clinical outcomes are also important measures of the impact an ASP has on a hospital and its patient population. Antimicrobial measures looking at consumption are the most commonly used measures, and are focused on defined daily doses, days of therapy, and costs, usually standardized per 1,000 patient-days. Each measure provides slightly different information, with their own upsides and downfalls. Point prevalence measurement of antimicrobial use is an increasingly used approach to understanding consumption that does not entirely rely on sophisticated electronic information systems, and is also replicable. Appropriateness measures hold appeal and promise, but have not been developed to the degree that makes them useful and widely applicable. The primary reason why antimicrobial stewardship is necessary is the growth of antimicrobial resistance. Accordingly, antimicrobial resistance is an important metric of the impact of an ASP. The most common approach to measuring resistance for ASP purposes is to report rates of common or important community- or nosocomial-acquired antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. Such an approach is dependent on detection methods, community rates of resistance, and co-interventions, and therefore may not be the most accurate or reflective measure of antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Development of an index to reflect the net burden of resistance holds theoretical promise, but has yet to be realized. Finally, programs must consider patient outcome measures. Mortality is the most objective and reliable method, but has several drawbacks. Disease- or organism-specific mortality, or cure, are increasingly used metrics.},

abstract = {The defined daily dose (DDD) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been the most frequently used unit of measurement to measure antibiotic use. However, measuring antibiotic use in paediatrics is a problem as the WHO DDD methodology is not applicable in children (aged {\textgreater}1 month) due to the large variation in body weight within this population. Based on the narrow range of body weights in the neonatal population, we therefore aimed to develop a set of neonatal DDDs for antibiotics. Eight well-respected (inter)national sources for dosage recommendations of antibiotics in children and neonates were consulted for the assumed maintenance dose of the ten most frequently used antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units in its main indication for neonates. A set of neonatal DDDs for ten commonly used antibiotics in neonates based on an assumed neonatal weight of 2 kg was proposed. Primarily in children DDDs are not applicable to quantify antibiotic use since there is large variation in body weight. In the neonatal population, however, based on its narrow range of body weights and when access to patient level data is not available, neonatal DDDs can be used as a unit of measurement.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]]]]]{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[{\textgreater}{\textless}/val{\textgreater}},

Additionally, this should counteract resistance development. It is, however, vital that correct and timely diagnostics are performed in parallel, and that an institution runs a well-organized infection prevention program. Currently, there is no clear consensus on which interventions an ASP should comprise. Indeed this depends on the institution, the region, and the patient population that is served. Different interventions will lead to different effects. Therefore, adequate evaluations, both clinically and financially, are crucial. Here, we provide a general overview of, and perspective on different intervention strategies and methods to evaluate these ASP programs, covering before mentioned topics. This should lead to a more consistent approach in evaluating these programs, making it easier to compare different interventions and studies with each other and ultimately improve infection and patient management.},

abstract = {The antimicrobial agents are unique drugs for several reasons. First, their efficacy is higher than other drugs in terms of reduction of morbidity and mortality. Also, antibiotics are the only group of drugs associated with ecological effects, because their administration may contribute to the emergence and spread of microbial resistance. Finally, they are used by almost all medical specialties. Appropriate use of antimicrobials is very complex because of the important advances in the management of infectious diseases and the spread of antibiotic resistance. Thus, the implementation of programs for optimizing the use of antibiotics in hospitals (called PROA in this document) is necessary. This consensus document defines the objectives of the PROA (namely, to improve the clinical results of patients with infections, to minimise the adverse events associated to the use of antimicrobials including the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, and to ensure the use of the most cost-efficacious treatments), and provides recommendations for the implementation of these programs in Spanish hospitals. The key aspects of the recommendations are as follows. Multidisciplinary antibiotic teams should be formed, under the auspices of the Infection Committees. The PROA need to be considered as part of institutional programs and the strategic objectives of the hospital. The PROA should include specific objectives based on measurable indicators, and activities aimed at improving the use of antimicrobials, mainly through educational activities and interventions based more on training activities directed to prescribers than just on restrictive measures. ?? 2011 SEFH.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospital antibiotic use can be measured by calculating daily doses as defined by the WHO/ATC index (DDD) divided by the number of patient or occupied bed days. We wondered whether changes in antibiotic use density over time at a university hospital using this data format are similar in order of magnitude when compared with a different, alternative dose definition and the number of admissions rather than the number of patient days as denominator. METHODS: Data obtained from the hospital pharmacy for the medical and surgical services of a 1,000-bed university hospital for the period 1992 through 2003 were expressed both in daily doses per 100 patient days and daily doses per admission. A PDD dose definition (prescribed daily doses), defining doses that reflect the usually prescribed dose in adult hospitalized patients with normal renal function was compared with the WHO/ATC 2001 DDD dose definitions. The percent changes using the different data formats between two 3-year averages (1992-1994 and 2001-2003) were calculated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The DDD/100 patient days data format overestimated antibiotic use density changes in this hospital both in medicine (81{\%} vs 48{\%}) as well as in surgery (69{\%} vs 39{\%}) when compared with PDD/100 patient days. Due to changes in the number of admissions and length of stay over the years, the percent change between the two periods expressed in doses per 100 patient days in addition differed substantially from that estimated by using the DDD per admission or PDD per admission data format. Studies evaluating the evolution of hospital antibiotic use need to address the limitations and adequacy of the different data formats.},

abstract = {Reports on antibiotic use often lack complete definitions of the units of measurement, hampering the comparison of data between hospitals or hospital units. To compare methods of measures of in-hospital antimicrobial use, we determined aggregate in-hospital consumption data at a tertiary care university hospital using variations of nominators and denominators. Means of defined daily doses (DDD) of individual antimicrobials per 100 bed-days and per 100 admissions at each hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) were calculated. Furthermore, a literature review was performed for benchmarking purposes. Antibiotic use in different hospital units ranged from 0.105 to 323.37 DDD/100 bed-days and from 4.23 to 6737.92 DDD/100 admissions, respectively. Including the day of discharge in the denominator 'bed-days' underestimated antibiotic use in various hospital wards by up to 27.7 DDD/100 bed-days (26.0{\%}). Equating 'numbers of patients admitted to the hospital' and 'numbers of admissions' on a hospital level resulted in a difference of 192.6 DDD/100 admissions (64{\%}) because patients transferred between hospital units accounted for multiple admissions. Likewise, reporting antimicrobial (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] group 'J') instead of antibiotic (ATC group 'J01') use led to a difference of 16.5 DDD/100 bed-days (19.3{\%}). The literature review revealed underreporting of complete definitions of antibiotic use measurements. Data on in-hospital antimicrobial use vary widely not only due to different antibiotic policies at different institutions but also due to different methods of measures. Adherence to the standard of reporting the methods of measurement is warranted for benchmarking and promotion of rational antimicrobial use.},

Previous studies have found discrepancies between DDDs, daily doses as recommended in practice guidelines (recommended daily doses, RDDs), and truly prescribed daily doses (PDDs). Very few studies have quantified these discrepancies. METHODS: A point prevalence survey was carried out in defined acute care service areas of a large German state university hospital. Of the 941 adult inpatients present on the day of the survey for whom adequate information was available, 267 (28{\%}) had 471 prescriptions for antimicrobial drugs on that specific day. A check for any additional antimicrobial drug prescriptions for these 267 patients during the six days immediately preceding the survey day yielded a total of 2,304 PDDs, of which 1,754 were antibacterial agents. The latter antibacterial drug PDDs constituted the basis for analysis. The proportion of PDDs different from RDDs and from DDDs was evaluated, and the deviations were calculated. RDD dose definitions corresponded to the local practice guideline recommendations of antibiotic therapy for adult hospitalized patients with normal renal function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 1,754 PDDs, 625 were matching DDD dose definitions (36{\%}), and 1,024 (58{\%}) were matching RDD dose definitions (p {\textless} 0.01). Corresponding values for patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance {\textless} 50 ml/min) were 36{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively. Large DDD discrepancies ({\textless} 50{\%} of prescribed doses matching DDD definitions) were noted for beta-lactams and macrolides, while large RDD discrepancies were observed for aminoglycosides. Compared with PDDs, the use of DDDs as the measurement of hospital antibiotic use overestimated antibiotic use volumes by 32{\%}, while the use of RDD led to a slight underestimation (-9{\%}).CONCLUSION: The use of DDDs as currently defined by WHO/ATC for measuring hospital antibiotic consumption may be associated with a substantial overestimation of antibiotic use density, while using practice guideline-derived RDDs may yield more valid antibiotic exposure estimates that would be helpful in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of antibiotic consumption.},

Use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs for systemic administration was categorized and expressed as antimicrobial-days (each day that each antimicrobial drug was given to each patient) and patient-days receiving antimicrobials (each day that any antimicrobial drug was given to each patient). Monthly rates were compiled and analyzed centrally, with ICU patient-days as the denominator. Results were validated against data collected from manual review of medical records. Frequent discussion among investigators aided identification and correction of programming problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: AU data were successfully programmed though a reiterative process of computer code revision. After identifying and resolving major programming errors, comparison of computerized patient-level data with data collected by manual review of medical records revealed discrepancies in antimicrobial-days and patient-days receiving antimicrobials that ranged from less than 1{\%} to 17.7{\%}. The hospital from which numerator data were derived from electronic records of medication administration had the least discrepant results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Computerized AU measures can be derived feasibly, but threats to validity must be sought out and corrected. The magnitude of discrepancies between computerized AU data and a gold standard based on manual review of medical records varies, with electronic records of medication administration providing maximal accuracy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are recommended to optimize antimicrobial use for hospitalized patients. Although mechanisms for the implementation of ASPs have been described, data-driven approaches to prioritize specific conditions and antimicrobials for intervention have not been established. We aimed to develop a strategy for identifying high-impact targets for antimicrobial stewardship efforts. DESIGn: Retrospective cross-sectional study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING AND PATIENTS: Children admitted to 32 freestanding children's hospitals in the United States in 2010.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We identified the conditions with the largest proportional contribution to the total days of antibiotic therapy prescribed to all hospitalized children. For the 4 highest-using conditions, we examined variability between hospitals in antibiotic selection patterns for use of either first- or second-line therapies depending on the condition. Antibiotic use was determined using standardized probability of exposure to selected agents and standardized days of therapy per 1,000 patient-days, adjusting for patient demographics and severity of illness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 2010, 524,364 children received 2,082,929 days of antibiotic therapy. Surgical patients received 43{\%} of all antibiotics. The 4 highest-using conditions-pneumonia, appendicitis, cystic fibrosis, and skin and soft-tissue infection-represent 1{\%} of all conditions yet accounted for more than 10{\%} of all antibiotic use. Wide variability in antibiotic use occurred for 3 of these 4 conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use in children's hospitals varied broadly across institutions when examining diagnoses individually and adjusting for severity of illness. Identifying conditions with both frequent and variable antimicrobial use informs the prioritization of high-impact targets for future antimicrobial stewardship interventions.},

abstract = {Background Medication incidents (MIs) account for 11.3 {\%} of all reported patient-safety incidents in England and Wales. Approximately one-third of inpatients are pre-scribed an antibiotic at some point during their hospital stay. The WHO has identified incident reporting as one solution to reduce the recurrence of adverse incidents. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the number and nature of reported antibiotic-associated MIs occurring in inpatients and to use defined daily doses (DDDs) to calculate the incident rate for the antibiotics most commonly associated with MIs at each hospital. Setting Two UK acute NHS teaching hospitals. Methods Retrospective quantitative analysis was performed on antibiotic-associated MIs reported to the risk management system over a 2-year period. Quality-assurance measures were undertaken before analysis. The study was approved by the clinical audit departments at both hospitals. Drug con-sumption data from each hospital were used to calculate the DDD for each antibiotic. Main outcome measures The num-ber of antibiotic-related MIs reported and the incident rate for the 10 antibiotics most commonly associated with MIs at each hospital. Results Healthcare staff submitted 6,756 reports, of which 885 (13.1 {\%}) included antibiotics. This resulted in a total of 959 MIs. Most MIs occurred during prescribing (42.4 {\%}, n = 407) and administration (40.0 {\%}, n = 384) stages. Most common types of MIs were omission/delay (26.3 {\%}, n = 252), and dose/frequency (17.9 {\%}, n = 172). Penicillins (34.5 {\%}, n = 331) and aminoglycosides (16.6 {\%}, n = 159) were the most frequently reported groups with co-amoxiclav (16.8 {\%}, n = 161) and gentamicin (14.1 {\%}, n = 135) the most frequently reported drugs. Using DDDs to assess the incident rate showed that cefotaxime (105.4/10,000 DDDs), gentamicin (25.7/10,000 DDDs) and vancomycin (23.7/10,000 DDDs) had the highest rates. Conclusions This study highlights that detailed analysis of data from reports is essential in understanding MIs and developing strategies to prevent their recurrence. Using DDDs in the analysis of MIs allowed determination of an incident rate providing more useful information than the absolute numbers alone. It also highlighted the disproportionate risk associated with less commonly prescribed antibiotics not identified using MI reporting rates alone.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe antifungal drug use by using the number of defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 patient-days per antifungal, the number of days of therapy (DOT)/1000 patient-days per anti-fungal, and the mean dose in mg/kg/day per antifungal during a 10-year period. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study, in a mother-child university hospital center, with 400 pediatric beds and 100 obstetrics-gynecology beds. All inpatients who received 1 of the 7 autho-rized antifungals on the institution's local formulary in 2000-2001, 2005-2006, or 2010-2011 were included. Prescriptions for emergency department and outpatient clinics were excluded. The data were extracted from the patients' computerized medication profiles linked to patient admission, discharge, and transfer data. The DDD, DOT, and the mean dose in mg/kg/day were calculated for each antifungal and overall. RESULTS: There was a 2.97-fold increase in the overall number of DDD/1000 patient-days, from 14.8 in 2000-2001 to 37.5 in 2005-2006 and 43.9 in 2010-2011. There was a 2.97-fold increase in the overall number of DOT/1000 patient-days, from 22.8 in 2000-2001 to 50.3 in 2005-2006 and 67.8 in 2010-2011. CONCLUSIONS: It can be difficult to compare the use of antifungal drugs among institutions, owing to numerous factors, but it gives an idea about the consumption outside the studied center. Moreover, these ratios help to evaluate the use of antifungals within a same institution. These data could be correlated among others, with resistance patterns, in order to improve our daily practice concerning antifungal prescription.},

To compare antibiotic usage using the above indicators in hospitals with and without electronic prescribing systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Twelve hospitals were used in the study. Nine hospitals were selected and split into three cohorts (three high-scoring, three medium-scoring and three low-scoring) by their 2001 medicines management self-assessment scores (MMAS). An additional cohort of three electronic prescribing hospitals was included for comparison. MMAS were compared to antibiotic management scores (AMS) developed from a questionnaire relating specifically to control of antibiotics. FCEs and occupied bed-days were obtained from published statistics and statistical analyses of the DDD/100 bed-days and DDD/FCE were carried out using SPSS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The DDD/100 bed-days varied from 81.33 to 189.37 whilst the DDD/FCE varied from 2.88 to 7.43. The two indicators showed a high degree of correlation with r=0.74. MMAS were from 9 to 22 (possible range 0-23) and the AMS from 2 to 13 (possible range 0-22). The two scores showed a high degree of correlation with r=0.74. No correlation was established between either indicator and either score.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The WHO indicator for medicines utilization, DDD/100 bed-days, exhibited the same level of conformity as that exhibited from the use of the DDD/FCE indicating that the DDD/FCE is a useful additional indicator for identifying hospitals which require further study. The MMAS can be assumed to be an accurate guide to antibiotic medicines management controls. No relationship has been found between a high degree of medicines management control and the quantity of antibiotic prescribed.},

METHODS: Two hospitals with consistently high (A) and low (B) fluoroquinolone use in their haematology-oncology services between the years 1999 and 2002 were identified in a hospital antibiotic use surveillance project. Rates of in vitro resistance to fluoroquinolones in inpatients of the services were determined for Escherichia coli and coagulase-negative staphylococcal bloodstream isolates, and also for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus isolates from any site. RESULTS: Fluoroquinolone resistance of E. coli was significantly higher in hospital A than in hospital B, but there was no such correlation between fluoroquinolone use and resistance rates for P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. CONCLUSION: The impact of antibiotic consumption on the prevalence of resistance may differ widely between different pathogens. Interventions using ecological analyses of the relationship between hospital antibiotic use and resistance need to consider pathogen-specific dynamics in the emergence and control of bacterial resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 patient days is often used as an indicator for the selection pressure exerted by antibiotics in the hospital setting. However, this unit of measurement does not fully describe the selection pressure and is sensitive to changes in hospital resource indicators. Additional information is required to facilitate interpretation of this indicator. The number of DDD per 100 admissions could be a valuable additional tool. The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of units of measurement in quantifying antibiotic use data with regards to antibiotic resistance risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trends in antibiotic use in acute care Dutch hospitals between 1997-2001 were studied. Antibiotic use was expressed in DDD per 100 patient days and in DDD per 100 admissions. RESULTS: From 1997 to 2001, total systemic antibiotic use significantly increased from 47.2 to 54.7 DDD per 100 patient days, whereas expressed in DDD per 100 admissions it remained constant. Some individual antibiotics increases in DDD per 100 patient days were not accompanied by increases in DDD per 100 admissions and vice versa. The mean number of total DDD per hospital decreased (not significantly) between 1997 and 2001. The mean number of patient days, admissions and length of stay decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of variation in resource indicators and additional expression of the data in DDD per 100 admissions is imperative for a meaningful understanding of observed trends in antibiotic use expressed in DDD per 100 patient days. Further research is needed to determine the correlation between different measures of antibiotic use and the level of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Background Measurement of prescribing is an important component of antimicrobial stewardship. The standard unit of measurement in hospitals is defined daily doses denominated by bed days (e.g. DDDs per 1000 bed days) but alternatives have not been evaluated in depth.Methods Electronically prescribed doses of systemic antibacterials administered in this trust during 2008 were analysed in order to generate 10 indices of antimicrobial use for each of 14 departments. These indices were five measurements of consumption (DDDs, agent days, courses, antibiotic days and treatment periods) each denominated by two measurements of activity [bed days and finished consultant episodes (FCEs)].Results The 10 indices cluster into four groups within which they correlate well but between which correlation is poor. These four groups comprise a volume-related measurement of consumption (DDDs, agent days, antibiotic days) and an exposure-related measurement of consumption (courses, treatment periods), each denominated by either bed occupancy (bed days) or patient throughput (FCEs).Conclusions Indices within these four groups seem to provide different and complementary information. Restricting measurement of antimicrobial use to a single metric such as DDDs per 1000 bed days may be insufficient. It is not known which (if any) of these indices are the best predictors of antimicrobial-related risks such as resistance pressure or Clostridium difficile infection.},

abstract = {Objectives The WHO anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC)/defined daily dose (DDD) methodology is a standardized method of comparing antimicrobial use. The ATC/DDD is defined as the average maintenance daily dose of a drug used in a 70 kg adult, ignoring the considerable differences in body weight of neonates and children. The aim of this study was to develop a new standardized way of comparing rates of antimicrobial prescribing between European children's hospitals.Methods This pilot study at four European children's hospitals (in the UK, Greece and Italy) collected data including demographics, antibiotic use, dosing and indication in children and neonates over a 14 day period.Results A total of 1217 antibiotic prescriptions were issued with 47 different antibiotics used. Approximately half of all children and a third of all neonates received antibiotics, with wide variation between centres in the type and dose of antibiotic used. We propose a new pragmatic three-step algorithm. The first step includes a simple comparison of the proportion of hospitalized children on antibiotics by weight bands and the number of antimicrobials that account for 90{\%} of total DDD drug usage (DU90{\%}). The second step is a comparison of the dosing used (mg/kg/day). The third step is to compare overall drug exposure using DDD/100 bed days for standardized weight bands between centres.Conclusions This novel method has the potential to be a useful tool to provide antibiotic use comparator data and requires validation in a large prospective point prevalence study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a significant cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials is acknowledged as a key determinant of this phenomenon. Many approaches are advocated for reducing this inappropriate prescribing, including regulatory, professional and educational interventions. Mass media campaigns are often suggested as a useful tool in managing public expectations, but the evidence to support this is weak, as no controlled studies of such campaigns exist. Evaluating such campaigns is problematic, and uncontrolled observations are misleading. We report here the first controlled study of such an intervention in the use of antimicrobials. METHODS: Two sequential mass media campaigns, providing information on the appropriate use of antimicrobials, were conducted during early 2004 and 2005 in the North East of England. These messages were articulated in the campaign by the cartoon character 'Moxy Malone'. The campaigns were supported by printed materials, and in parts of this area, with professional education and prescribing support. A retrospective controlled before-after study was conducted, examining the effects on observed prescribing of antimicrobials for the populations covered by these two cycles of mass media campaigns. These populations were controlled with matched populations in the North of England. The primary outcome examined was prescribing rates (items) for all microbial agents for these populations, corrected for population structure (STAR-PU). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse factors that had a possible effect on the prescribing of antibacterial drugs. This was supported by a survey of primary care organizations (PCOs) of all interventions undertaken around antimicrobial use in the intervention and comparison populations. RESULTS: In this retrospective study, there was incomplete reporting of adjuvant interventions undertaken by the PCOs intervention and comparison areas, so isolating the intervention, and attributing cause and effect is difficult. In this pragmatic evaluation the campaign was found to significantly reduce the volume of antibacterial drugs during the winter months of the intervention years. There were 21.7 fewer items prescribed per 1000 population (P {\textless} 0.0005), for the intervention populations over these winter months, equivalent to a 5.8{\%} absolute reduction in prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Mass media campaigns have a role in changing antimicrobial prescribing practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conflicting evidence has been reported on the impact of ertapenem use on the susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. to group 2 carbapenems. No extensive data for Acinetobacter baumannii are currently available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A retrospective time-series segmented regression analysis was conducted in a tertiary centre from January 2001 to December 2011. Ertapenem was introduced in January 2005. Antimicrobial drug use was defined as the number of defined daily doses/100 patient-days (DDDs/100 PDs). Susceptibility (CLSI) was measured in terms of proportion and incidence density.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mean monthly use of imipenem was 2.9 ± 0.9 DDDs/100 PDs, as compared with 1.2 ± 0.7 DDDs/100 PDs for meropenem and 1.0 ± 0.7 DDDs/100 PDs for ertapenem (after its introduction). After ertapenem adoption, a downward trend was seen in the use of imipenem (P = 0.016) and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.004). A total of 6272 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1093 A. baumannii isolates were evaluated. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem improved after ertapenem introduction, both according to the proportion of susceptible isolates (P = 0.002) and to the incidence density of resistance (P ≤ 0.001). No significant change was seen in A. baumannii susceptibility to imipenem (P = 0.772). By multiple linear regression analysis, the incidence density of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa increased with the use of imipenem (P = 0.003) and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.008). Occurrence of outbreaks (P ≤ 0.001) and use of gentamicin (P = 0.007) were associated with A. baumannii resistance to imipenem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Use of ertapenem was directly associated with a downward trend in the use of imipenem and ciprofloxacin, which may have contributed to improve the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem. Ertapenem use had no impact on the susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem.},

abstract = {Objective: Inappropriate drug dosage is a serious problem in pediatrics, mainly due to the lack of clinical evidence in children, suitable preparation formulation, and standardized methods for dose adjustment. A method for evaluating and monitoring appropriate dosage in pediatrics is urgently needed. The drug utilization index (DUI) based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) has been widely used in the assessment of appropriate dosage in adults. We explored possible methods for assessing appropriate dosage in children. Methods: Based on our previous studies, we discuss cDUI in the assessment of appropriate dosage in children as follows: the meaning of cDDD, the establishment of a standardized system, and the classified evaluation of dosage in pediatrics. Results: Although the definition of cDDD draws on the concept of defined daily dose (DDD), the meaning of cDDD is different from that of the latter. Specifically, the purpose of cDDD is to evaluate appropriate pediatric dose, while DDD is a unit of measurement. cDDD could be used to assess dose rationality for common and serious pediatric diseases, and would be refined over time. A single cDDD should be assigned per drug and indication and given per drug and route of administration. The influence of age, weight, diagnosis, and administration route on the dosage should be considered. Classified evaluation should be used and weight should be given to the above mentioned factors in order to evaluate the appropriate dose objectively and comprehensively. Conclusions: Dosage regulation in pediatrics has an important role in improving medical quality and protecting the safety, effectiveness, and economy of medical therapy in children. The establishment of a cDUI system is a good try in pediatric dosage evaluation. Although there are still defects within this proposed system and methodology, the principle seems feasible.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial stewardship is a key component in the reduction of healthcare-associated infections, particularly Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We successfully restricted the use of cephalosporins and, subsequently, fluoroquinolones. From an endemically high level of {\textgreater}280 cases per year in 2007-08, the number of CDIs reduced to 72 cases in 2011-12. Aim: To describe the implementation and impact of fluoroquinolone restriction on CDI. Methods: This was an interrupted time-series analysis pre and post fluoroquinolone restriction for 60 months based on a Poisson distribution model. Findings: In June 2008, fluoroquinolone consumption halved to about 5 defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 occupied bed-days (OBD). This was followed by a significant fall in CDI number [rate ratio (RR): 0.332; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.240-0.460] which remained low over the subsequent months. Subsequently, fluoroquinolone consumption was further reduced to about 2 DDD/100 OBD in June 2010 accompanied by further reduction in CDI rate (RR: 0.394; 95{\%} CI: 0.199-0.781). In a univariate Poisson model the CDI rate was associated with fluoroquinolone usage (RR: 1.086; 95{\%} CI: 1.077-1.094). Conclusion: We conclude that in an environment where cephalosporin usage is already low, the reduction in fluoroquinolone usage was associated with an immediate, large, and significant reduction in CDI cases.},

abstract = {Antibiotic consumption during 1996 was measured in 15 large hospitals from 14 countries and 3000 consecutive Staphylococcus aureus samples were collected, allowing calculation of local resistance rates and typing of isolates. Antibiotic consumption data were converted to defined daily doses (DDD), and similar antibiotics were grouped if they belonged to the same therapeutic subgroup. Variations in hospital size were corrected by using DDD per 1000 bed-days. The total antibiotic consumption in the 15 hospitals varied between 296 DDD/1000 bed-days and 1108 DDD/1000 bed-days. Differences in the usage of therapeutical subgroups of antimicrobials varied significantly between hospitals. A positive correlation was found between S. aureus resistance to methicillin (MRSA) and consumption of beta-lactam combinations, between resistance to quinolones and consumption of beta-lactam combinations and carbapenems and resistance to aminoglycosides and consumption of beta-lactam combinations. The consumption of beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics was negatively correlated to resistance to methicillin, quinolones, and aminoglycosides. Usage of the different antimicrobial therapeutical subgroups was also correlated. Consumption of beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics (penicillin) was positively correlated to consumption of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and negatively correlated to consumption of carbapenems, quinolones, and glycopeptides, whereas consumption of cephalosporins was positively correlated to consumption of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and glycopeptides. In this study of hospitals with MRSA prevalence of between 0{\%} and 63{\%}, significant correlations were found between resistance and consumption of antimicrobials. These findings support the importance of antimicrobial consumption on resistance. An accompanying paper addresses the issue of antibiotic resistance and clonality of isolates},

There is an association between the use of antimicrobial agents and resistance that is likely causal. Alterations in antimicrobial usage have been shown to affect antimicrobial resistance rates, particularly with use of aminoglycosides. Efforts to improve antimicrobial use through educational efforts alone have been largely ineffective, even when coupled with quality management or clinical guideline aspects. Thus, further work is urgently needed to determine the impact of antimicrobial-use controls. Additional large-scale, well controlled trials of antimicrobial-use regulation employing sophisticated epidemiologic methods, molecular biological organism typing, and precise resistance mechanism analysis will be required to determine the best methods to prevent and control this problem and ensure our optimal antimicrobial-use "stewardship."

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variation in medical practice has identified opportunities for quality improvement in patient care. The degree of variation in the use of antibiotics in children's hospitals is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 556,692 consecutive pediatric inpatient discharges from 40 freestanding children's hospitals between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. We used the Pediatric Health Information System to acquire data on antibiotic use and clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Overall, 60{\%} of the children received at least 1 antibiotic agent during their hospitalization, including {\textgreater}90{\%} of patients who had surgery, underwent central venous catheter placement, had prolonged ventilation, or remained in the hospital for {\textgreater}14 days. Even after adjustment for both hospital- and patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics, antibiotic use varied substantially across hospitals, including both the proportion of children exposed to antibiotics (38{\%}-72{\%}) and the number of days children received antibiotics (368-601 antibiotic-days per 1000 patient-days). In general, hospitals that used more antibiotics also used a higher proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Children's hospitals vary substantially in their use of antibiotics to a degree unexplained by patient- or hospital-level factors typically associated with the need for antibiotic therapy, which reveals an opportunity to improve the use of these drugs.},

@article{Mandy2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: For several years now, the French national recommendations have been trying to set up a surveillance system in hospitals to link data on antibiotic resistance and data on the use of antibiotics, particularly for certain 'micro-organism/antibiotic' pairs. The indicators recommended in the lastest newsletter of the Direction G{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rale de la Sant{\'{e}} (French Public Health Department) for monitoring the consumption of antibiotics were the number of days of treatment or the number of defined daily doses (DDD), both (in)directly related to the number of days of hospitalisation and/or the number of patients hospitalised.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the actual number of days of treatment, which is an observed indicator, with two indicators calculated on the basis of the DDD and the DPD (daily prescribed dose), both in terms of feasibility of collection and the relevance of the information generated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For several hospital care units, the 'length of exposure' to a given antibiotic was determined by four different indicators: two actual observed indicators [the patient's medical file (reference) and the named-patient based, computerised dispensing system from the central pharmacy] and two derived calculated indicators [obtained by dividing the number of grams prescribed by the DDD or by the DPD]. RESULTS: The average incidence density of antibiotic treatment (length of exposure per 1000 days of hospitalisation) obtained by the calculated indicators was higher than that obtained with the observed reference (+52{\%} for the DDD and +33{\%} for the DPD) but lower than that obtained with the second observed indicator (computerised system) (-10{\%}). The differences were large and random (high variability depending on the hospital department, the antibiotic and the administration route; variations in both directions: actual length of treatment longer or shorter than the calculated length of treatment). CONCLUSION: The question which indicator should be chosen is inconclusive for the evaluation of the selection pressure exerted by an antibiotic. The two indicators proposed in the newsletter (observed indicator and calculated indicator) seem to be complementary for use in a regional or national network to monitor resistance and consumption of antibiotics. Each hospital should validate the indicators and define for itself which indicator is most appropriate for estimating the actual length of antibiotic exposure. This may imply different indicators for different units, antibiotics or even administration routes within one particular hospital setting. Once validated the hospital has a powerful tool generating data that can be linked to resistance data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to provide a national estimate of the number of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and deaths in United States hospitals. METHODS: No single source of nationally representative data on HAIs is currently available. The authors used a multi-step approach and three data sources. The main source of data was the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system, data from 1990-2002, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (for 2002) and the American Hospital Association Survey (for 2000) were used to supplement NNIS data. The percentage of patients with an HAI whose death was determined to be caused or associated with the HAI from NNIS data was used to estimate the number of deaths. RESULTS: In 2002, the estimated number of HAIs in U.S. hospitals, adjusted to include federal facilities, was approximately 1.7 million: 33,269 HAIs among newborns in high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-baby nurseries, 417,946 among adults and children in ICUs, and 1,266,851 among adults and children outside of ICUs. The estimated deaths associated with HAIs in U.S. hospitals were 98,987: of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites. CONCLUSION: HAIs in hospitals are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The method described for estimating the number of HAIs makes the best use of existing data at the national level.},

The present paper provides practical advice on the use of administrative pharmacy data to address this need.

Examples of consumption data from Canadian community and hospital settings, with comparisons to international data, are used to incite interest and to propose uses of this information. It is hoped that all persons responsible for policy decisions regarding licensing, reimbursement, prescribing guidelines, formulary controls or any other structure pertaining to antimicrobial use become conversant with the concepts of population antibiotic consumption and that this paper provides them with the impetus and direction to begin accurately measuring and comparing antibiotic use in their jurisdictions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Antimicrobial use contributes to the development of emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. There are few published data on antimicrobial use in neonatal (NICU) and pediatric ICU (PICU) patients.METHODS:Personnel at 31 Pediatric Prevention Network hospitals participated in point prevalence surveys on August 4, 1999 (summer) and February 8, 2000 (winter). Data collected for all NICU and PICU inpatients included demographics, antimicrobials and indications for use and therapeutic interventions.RESULTS:Data were reported for 2647 patients in 29 NICUs (827 patients in summer; 753 in winter) and 35 PICUs (512 patients in summer; 555 in winter). PICU patients were more likely than NICU patients to be receiving antimicrobials on the survey date [758 of 1070 (70.8{\%}) versus 684 of 1582 (43.2{\%}), P {\textless} 0.0001]. NICU patients were receiving a higher median number of antimicrobials (2 versus 1, P {\textless} 0.0001). The most common agents among NICU patients were gentamicin, ampicillin and vancomycin; the most common agents among PICU patients were cefazolin, vancomycin and cefotaxime. Use of aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins and topical antibacterials was significantly more common in NICU patients; first, second and third generation cephalosporins, extended spectrum penicillins, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, antianaerobic agents, systemic antifungals and systemic antivirals were more common in PICU patients.CONCLUSIONS:This is the first U.S. national multicenter description of antimicrobial use in NICUs and PICUs and demonstrates the high prevalence of antimicrobial use among these patients. Assessment strategies targeting antimicrobial use in pediatrics are needed.},

@article{Cantey2015,
abstract = {Background: Prolonged or unnecessary antibiotic use is associated with adverse outcomes in neonates. Our objectives were to quantify all antibiotic use in a Level-III neonatal intensive care unit and to identify scenarios where their use could be reduced. Methods: Surveillance and evaluation of all antibiotic use provided to every infant admitted to a Level-III neonatal intensive care unit from 10/3/11 to 11/30/12 was performed. Types of antibiotics, reasons for their initiation, discontinuation and duration, as well as clinical, laboratory and outcome data were recorded. Antibiotic use was quantified by days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient-days (PD). Results: A total of 1607 infants were included. The total antibiotic use was 9165 DOT (343.2 DOT/1000 PD; 5.7 DOT/infant). Seventy-two percent of infants received 1 (43{\%}) or more (29{\%}) courses of antibiotics. Gentamicin (46{\%}), ampicillin (39{\%}) and oxacillin (8{\%}) were the most frequently used agents. Ninety-four percent of antibiotic use (323 DOT/1000 PD) was empiric therapy for suspected infection. Sixty-three percent (216.2 DOT/1000 PD) was discontinued at approximately 48 hours when cultures were sterile (68{\%} {\textgreater}48 hours, 32{\%} ≤48 hours). Twenty-six percent of all antibiotic use (89.4 DOT/1000 PD) was therapy for ≥5 days despite sterile cultures; pneumonia (16{\%}) and "culture-negative" sepsis (8{\%}) were the major contributors. Five percent (17.4 DOT/1000 PD) of antibiotic use was for culture-proven sepsis, 5{\%} (16.6 DOT/1000 PD) was penicillin prophylaxis for group B Streptococcus and 1{\%} (3.5 DOT/1000 PD) was preprocedural prophylaxis. Conclusions: Narrow-spectrum therapy accounted for {\textgreater}92{\%} of antibiotic use and would not be monitored by most stewardship programs. Only 5{\%} of antibiotic usage was due to culture-proven infection. Pneumonia and "culture-negative" sepsis were frequent reasons for prolonged therapy; further study of these conditions may allow reduction in treatment duration.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To derive cost comparators for prescribing by English general practitioners in eight specific therapeutic groups, based on age-sex related weightings, and to confirm, from a new dataset, earlier age-sex weightings for overall prescribing (ASTRO-PUs). DESIGN: Calculations based on one year's prescribing data from selected practices using AAH Meditel software, held on MediPlus by Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS, UK and Ireland), and research practices using VAMP software, held on the General Practice Research Database. SETTING: 112 English practices with 739,672 patients and 510 British practices with 3,126,570 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost based weightings for 18 age-sex groups and for temporary residents for eight leading specific therapeutic groups and for prescribing overall. RESULTS: The two datasets were similar in age distribution and in the way that prescription numbers were distributed by age-sex band in each therapeutic group. The cost based weightings for specific therapeutic groups showed great variation in the use of these groups for patients in different age-sex groups. When these weightings were applied to the prescribing of practices in two family health services authorities they differed in their power to predict prescribing costs: for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal drugs predictive power was particularly high; for drugs for infections it was particularly low, since these are widely used at all ages and for both sexes. Cost based weightings for overall prescribing derived from the IMS data were similar to those of the ASTRO-PU system even though they were derived by different methods from different datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The weightings (STAR-PUs) offer a sound basis for cost comparisons at the therapeutic group level. Cost-based weightings for overall prescribing derived from the IMS data were reassuringly similar to those of the existing ASTRO-PU system.},
